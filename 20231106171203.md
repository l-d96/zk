# Go switch statement
A `switch` statement is a shorter way to write a sequence of `if - else` statements.
It runs the first case whose value is equal to the condition expression.

Go's `switch` is like the one in C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and PHP, except that Go
only runs the selected case, not all the cases that follow. In effect, the `break`
statement that is needed at the end of each case in those languages is provided
automatically in Go. Another important difference is that Go's switch cases need
not be constants, and the values involved need not be integers.

E.g.:
```go
package main

import (
"fmt"
"runtime"
)

func main() {
fmt.Print("Go runs on ")
switch os := runtime.GOOS; os {
case "darwin":
fmt.Println("OS X.")
case "linux":
fmt.Println("Linux.")
default:
// freebsd, openbsd,
// plan9, windows...
fmt.Printf("%s.\n", os)
}
}
```

Switch cases evaluate cases from top to bottom, stopping when a case succeeds.
```go
package main

import (
"fmt"
"time"
)

func main() {
fmt.Println("When's Saturday?")
today := time.Now().Weekday()
switch time.Saturday {
case today + 0:
fmt.Println("Today.")
case today + 1:
fmt.Println("Tomorrow.")
case today + 2:
fmt.Println("In two days.")
default:
fmt.Println("Too far away.")
}
}
```

Switch without a condition is the same as switch true.

This construct can be a clean way to write long if-then-else chains.

E.g.:
```go
package main

import (
"fmt"
"time"
)

func main() {
t := time.Now()
switch {
case t.Hour() < 12:
fmt.Println("Good morning!")
case t.Hour() < 17:
fmt.Println("Good afternoon.")
default:
fmt.Println("Good evening.")
}
}
```
