# Go exported names
In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter.
For example, Pizza is an exported name, as is Pi, which is exported from the math package.

pizza and pi do not start with a capital letter, so they are not exported.

When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names.
Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.

E.g. the following code will error out:
```go
package main

import (
"fmt"
"math"
)

func main() {
fmt.Println(math.pi)
}
```

the following code is correct:
```go
package main

import (
"fmt"
"math"
)

func main() {
fmt.Println(math.Pi)
}
```
