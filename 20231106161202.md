# Go type conversions
The expression `T(v)` converts the value v to the type T.

Some numeric conversions:
```go
var i int = 42
var f float64 = float64(i)
var u uint = uint(f)
```

or

```go
i := 42
f := float64(i)
u := uint(f)
```

Unlike in C, Go assignments between items of different types require an
explicit conversion.
