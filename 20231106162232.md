# Go for loop
Go has only one looping construct, the `for` loop.

The basic `for` loop has three components separated by semicolons:
- the `init` statement: executed before the first iteration;
- the `condition` expression: evaluated before every iteration;
- the `post` statement: executed at the end of every iteration.

The `init` statement will often be a very short variable declaration,
and the variables declared there are visible only in the scope of the
`for` statement.

The loop will stop iterating once the boolean condition evaluates to `false`

E.g.:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
sum := 0
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
sum += i
}
fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

The `init` and `post` statements are optional:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
sum := 1
for ; sum < 1000; {
sum += sum
}
fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

... at which point you can drop the semicolons; C's `while` is spelled `for` in Go.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
sum := 1
for sum < 1000 {
sum += sum
}
fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

if you omit the loop condition, it loops forever.
