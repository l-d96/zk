# Go named return values
Go's return values may be named. If so, they are treated
as variables defined at the top of the function.

These names should be used to document the meaning of
the return values.

A return statement without arguments returns the named
return values. This is known as a "naked" return.

Naked return statements should be used only in short
functions, as with the example shown here. They can
harm readability in longer functions.

E.g.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func split(sum int) (x, y int) {
x = sum * 4 / 9
y = sum - x
return
}

func main() {
fmt.Println(split(17))
}
```
