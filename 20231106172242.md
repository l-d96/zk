# Go defer statement
A defer statement defers the execution of a function
until the surrounding function returns.

The deferred call's arguments are evaluated immediately,
but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns.

E.g.:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
defer fmt.Println("world")

fmt.Println("hello")
}
```

Deferred functions calls are pushed onto a stack.
When a function returns, its deferred calls are executed in last-in-first-out order.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
fmt.Println("counting")

for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
defer fmt.Println(i)
}

fmt.Println("done.")
}
```
