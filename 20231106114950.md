# Go variable short declaration
Inside a function, the `:=` short assignment statement can be
used in place of a var declaration with implicit type.

Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword
(var, func, and so on) and so the `:=` construct is not available.

E.g.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
var i, j int = 1, 2
k := 3
c, python, java := true, false, "no!"

fmt.Println(i, j, k, c, python, java)
}
```
