# Go imports

You can import packages using two syntaxes:
- the "factored" syntax
- the "import" syntax

It is good practice to use the "factored" syntax

E.g. "factored"
```go
package main

import (
"fmt"
"math"
)

func main() {
fmt.Printf("Now you have %g problems.\n", math.Sqrt(7))
}
```

E.g. "import"
```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "math"

func main() {
fmt.Printf("Now you have %g problems.\n", math.Sqrt(7))
}
```
